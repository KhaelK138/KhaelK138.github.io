## Business Notes

**Number 1 reason companies go out of business is running out of money**
- Can be clever to secure a line of credit with a bank like JPMC for some amount of money per month, just in case of worst-case scenario

**Getting more work from existing work**
- Always make sure to take notes during the engagement to see where we'd want to go next with the customer
- Asking customer constantly "When do you expect to have this done by?" for the Purchase Order (PO)
- In big calls, can consider reintroducing the company and what we offer before going into the specific call information
  - This can help sell other service offerings, like selling unrelated AI on a red team sales call

**Start big, take it smaller, give customer optionality**
- If the customer doesn't want or can't afford a red team based on budget, then definitely try and do something smaller
- If a red team is $150k but all they have is $80k, we can do an assumed breach instead, which saves them money on the social engineering and such 
- If low on time, can always record a video discussing the options and how much they cost, which we can send to the client


## Terminology
