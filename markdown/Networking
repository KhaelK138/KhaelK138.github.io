## Networking Notes

Not making networking its own section for a while (I'm not cracked enough)

**Connecting to LAN over USB**
- Make sure to manually set IP and interface via Network settings after connecting via USB, if DHCP isn't set up
- Can then configure things like kali to use the interface, which will actually give kali its own IP on the network (rather than sharing the hosts)
  - Can be very handy when we need to host things on kali


## Configure Managed Switch to Mirror Traffic

- On a Netgear GS305E switch, for example, it's possible to mirror traffic from one port on the switch to another
- This enables MITM attacks pretty easy, though you naturally have to be physically present to make it happen

**Setup**
- Let's say we're MITM-ing a firewall and a PC, which currently have a direct ethernet connection between one another
- Using the web GUI, configure the switch to mirror traffic from port 1 to port 5
- Plug firewall ethernet into port 1, and plug port 2 into the PC
  - Routing should be automatically handled, even if (and maybe only if) the IP range doesn't match the range of the switch itself
    - Switch is 192.168.0.239 by default, I changed mine to 172.16.1.239 just to avoid any conflicts
- Plug port 5 into attacker machine, and set IPv4 to disabled (setting it to passive mode, since it'll be a 1-way connection)
- Now we can just use something like WireShark to sniff the traffic on that network interface, which should essentially be like watching the original ethernet connection itself

**Issues**
- Macs might try to use switch over WiFi automatically, but you can go to the bottom of Networking settings and change the priority of each network interface
- Mac might even say the interface is "Not connected" after disabling IPv4, but we'll still be receiving the traffic on the interface, so WireShark will still work

## Firewalling

- Rules are usually taken in order, so first rules take precedence
- TODO: fill out from https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VX4EFOVBW5znfWVw5AJtrkmAt5-dFTOOfjsqqNbRJcw/edit?pli=1&slide=id.g3a339518901_0_10#slide=id.g3a339518901_0_10

**Iptables**
- Changes are automatically applied
- `iptables --list-rules`
- Accept traffic on a port: `iptables -A {INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD} -p {tcp/udp} --dport {port} -j {ACCEPT/DROP/LOG}`
  - Can pass a specific table with `-t {table_like_NAT}`
  - `-s {IP}` to pass an IP (range) for allowing/denying
  - To delete a rule, replace `-A` with `-D` and keep the rest of the rule the same
- Flush all rules: `iptables -F INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD`

**ufw**
- `ufw {enable/disable}`
- Status of a rule `ufw status {rule_num}`
- Allow a port: `ufw allow 22/tcp`
- Allow from IP: `ufw allow from {IP}`
  - Can add `to any port 22`
- Deny all outgoing by default: `ufw default deny outgoing`
- `firewalld` is similar and present on RHEL

**nftables**
- Conf in `/etc/nftables.conf`
- `nft list ruleset` to list rules, flush with `nft flush ruleset`
- Add port with `nft add rule inet filter input tcp dport 80`
- Block IP with `nft add rule inet filter input ip saddr {IP} drop`
- Delete rule with `nft delete rule inet filter input handle {rule_number}`

**Windows**
- Allow a port: `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "{name}" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort {port} -Protocol TCP -Action Allow`
